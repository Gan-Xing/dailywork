# Finance Module (记账) Draft

## Scope
- One row equals one accounting entry; focuses on quick capture for later reporting.
- Supports create/read/update/delete, with automatic sequence numbering.
- Finance records are project-scoped; project selection is mandatory.
- Category and payment type should be maintainable lists (seeded defaults are fine).

## Fields (per entry)
- `sequence` (auto): incremental number generated by the system.
- `project` (select): the project/road this entry belongs to.
- `reason` (text): brief description of the transaction.
- `category` (select): classification bucket (e.g., 材料, 人工, 租赁).
- `amount` (decimal): numeric amount; ties to `unit`.
- `unit` (text): e.g., 元, 万元.
- `paymentType` (select): e.g., 现金, 转账, POS, 其他.
- `paymentDate` (date): when the payment was made.
- `tva` (decimal): tax amount/TVA for the entry.
- `remark` (text, optional): any supplemental note.

## UX/Entry Points
- Homepage adds a “财务记账” module card linking to `/finance` as the third core entry.
- Future list view: sortable table with filters by project, category, payment type, date range.
- Editing: inline row edit or drawer; deletion requires confirm dialog.

## Open Questions
- Do we need multi-currency support or exchange rates?
- Should `amount` store tax-exclusive or tax-inclusive values (current plan assumes tax-inclusive with explicit `tva`)?
- Permissions: who can edit/delete vs. view-only?
